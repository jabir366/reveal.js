    ## Protocol
- A communication protocol is a set of rules for exchanging information over a network. 
- Network devices communicate via protocols

    ## OSI Model
- It is a reference model that specifies standards for communications protocols and also the functionalities of each layer.
- 7 layers
  1. Physical Layer : Transfer bits
  2. Data-Link Layer : Deal with frames id:-MAC
  3. Network Layer   : Deal with packets id:-IP
  4. Transport Layer : Deal with Segment id:-port
  5. Session Layer   : synchronization,session establishment
  6. Presentation Layer : encryption, decryption,compression

  7. Application Layer : allow user to send data

	## Why we need both IP and MAC?
- MAC is for node to node delivery
  - packet send to immediate node by using MAC
  - IP is for sending packet over networks
