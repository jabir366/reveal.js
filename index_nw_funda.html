    ## What is a Network ?
- A network consists of two or more computers that are linked in order to share resources
- A network includes different types of devices known as Networking devices
- Most common types of Networks are 
  - LAN (Local Area Network)
  - WAN (Wide Area Network)
  - MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
  - PAN (Personal Area Network)
  - VPN (Virtual Private Network)

    ## Network topology
- Network topology refers to how devices are inter connected, eg:-
  - Bus
  - Star
  - Mesh
  - Tree
  - Hybrid
  - Ring
    <!-- A paragraph with some text and a [link](http://hakim.se). -->

    ## Networking devices
- NIC      : device where packet receives 
- Repeater : repeates the signal 
- Hub      : mutliport repeater
- Bridge   : used to segment LANs
- Switch   : Used to send packets over network
- Router   : Forward data across network
- Gateway  : HW/SW act as entry of a network
- Firewall : HW/SW with access control
    ---
    ## Protocol
- A communication protocol is a set of rules for exchanging information over a network. 
- Network devices communicate via protocols
- We use different protocols in network stack
    ---
	## layers
	- Each layer abstracts the services of various lower layers
	- Provides a uniform interface to higher layers.
	- Each layer has specific purpose,which wraps or unwraps some data it is getting
    ---
    ## OSI Model
- It is a reference model that specifies standards for communications protocols and also the functionalities of each layer.
- 7 layers
  1. Physical Layer : Transfer bits
  2. Data-Link Layer : Deal with frames id:-MAC
  3. Network Layer   : Deal with packets id:-IP
  4. Transport Layer : Deal with Segment id:-port
  5. Session Layer   : synchronization,session establishment
  6. Presentation Layer : encryption, decryption,compression
  7. Application Layer : allow user to send data

	## TCP/IP Model
	- A communication protocol suite
	- Implementation of the OSI model
	- Has 4 layers
	  - Network interface layer
	  - Internet layer
	  - Transport layer
	  - Application layer

    ---
	## Why we need both IP and MAC?
- MAC is for node to node delivery
  - packet send to immediate node by using MAC
  - IP is for sending packet over networks 
    ---
	## IPv4 Addresses
	- 32 bits long, split into 4 octets:
	  - For example, 128.95.2.24
	- Ip address has 2 parts 
	  - Network part
	  - Host part
	- classes
	  - A : Public and private range, for larger networks
	  - B : Public and private range, for medium networks
	  - C : Public and private range, for small networks
	  - D : Address range, used for multicasting
	  - E : Address range Not available for use, reserved

	## CIDR
	- Stands for classless interdomain routing
	- Reduces wastage of IP Addresses
	- Example  192.168.15.3/21

```
Address:  192.168.15.3
Netmask:  255.255.248.0 = 21
Wildcard: 0.0.7.255
Network:  192.168.8.0/21
HostMin:  192.168.8.1
HostMax:  192.168.15.254
Broadcast:192.168.15.255
```
    ---
	## subnetting
	- Breaking the networks to smaller ones
	- Improves security
	- Reduces congestion in network
	- Subnet mask : a node use this to identify network part and host part of an IP address
	- Default gateway: gateway to outside of network
	- VLAN: logical division of a network
	- We can create subnets in VLANs also 
    ---
	## How devices communicate in LAN
	- Scenario : A wants to send a packet to B
	- Condition : A and B needs to be in same network
	- A has the IP of B 
	- A sends a ARP request (broadcast) with IP of B
	- B receives the message and send ARP reply to A 
	- Now A has MAC of B and sends the Packet

    ---
	## How devices communicate across networks
	- Scenario : A wants to send a packet to B 
	- Condition : A and B needs to be in different network
	- A has the IP of B 
	- A sends ARP to gateway and gets its MAC
	- A sends packet to address B with MAC of gateway
	- Gateway does the same operation until packet reaches destination

	## NAT
	- network address translation
	- solve inadequacy of 32 bit IPv4 addresse
